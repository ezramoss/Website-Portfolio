                <h2>Arizona State Univeristy</h2>
                <h3>Master's Degree in Software Engineering</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text"><strong>Software Development:</strong> This course delved into the complexities of building software systems that operate in distributed environments. Topics included distributed systems architecture, communication protocols, fault tolerance, and scalability. Through practical assignments, I gained hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining software across multiple machines or devices.</p>
                <p class="card-text"><strong>Software Quality Management: </strong>This course emphasized the delivery of reliable, maintainable, and defect-free software. I explored quality assurance processes, metrics, and best practices. Topics included defect tracking, process improvement, and quality control.</p>
                <p class="card-text"><strong>Systems Engineering: </strong>Systems engineering provided a holistic perspective on complex software systems. I studied requirements engineering, system architecture, and system integration. The course underscored the importance of understanding the entire software lifecycle and managing trade-offs effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Machine Learning: </strong>In this class, I delved into the foundations of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. I gained practical experience using popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The curriculum covered supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, and deep learning.</p>

                <h3>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text"><strong>Databases:</strong> Learned about relational and non-relational databases and worked with structured query language commands and MySQL for data selection and manipulation.</p>
                <p class="card-text"><strong>Operating Systems: </strong>Explored important concepts including process scheduling, memory management, file systems, and security. Worked closing with the x86 architecture and a simulation of a modifiable operating system. Discovered how operating systemsÂ oversee resource allocation and serve as the bridge between user programs and hardware.</p>
                <p class="card-text"><strong>Data Communications and Networks: </strong>Studied the transmission of information across networks using protocols like TCP/IP, UDP, and HTTP. Explored various network topologies, network security, traffic and packet analysis, and data encryption. Learned about important topics relating to cloud computing, IoT, and big data.</p>
                <p><strong>Robotics: </strong>Explored the design, control, and programming of autonomous and semiautonomous Arduino Uno systems with C#. Topics include kinematics (how robots move), actuators, and path planning. Utilized a variety of sensors including infrared, sonar, GPS, and contact pads.</p>
